# ASpathfinding

This project target is to create a sand box environement to test path finding algorithms
you can  put walls and choose the starting and ending point

for the moment the project use only the A* algorithm to find the path

To improve this project we could :
* use optimisation method to lower the computation necessary to find a path
* check if the path optimal for all cases
* create different algorithms that could find a path; for instance drijska algorithm and others
